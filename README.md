Literacy Gap Dataset Analysis using Excel
Objective:- This project aims to analyse the literacy rates of men and women in the years 2001,2011, and 2021 in a dataset collected by the government of India. Using data analysis techniques to understand gender disparities and trends in literacy. It aims to assess male and female literacy rates over the years, identify patterns, and help make data-driven decisions in educational planning.
Dataset Preparation:
•	Removed unnecessary columns and ensured data consistency. 
•	Handled missing values. 
Data Analysis & Calculations 
•	Used Excel formulas and pivot tables to summarise data analysis.
Visualisations and insights:
Used Bar charts to compare the Male and Female Literacy rates in India in the 3 years, to see the trend of literacy rate, a line chart was used, cards were used to show the gender gap, the national average literacy in 2021, and the most improved state in 2021.
Final Outcome:
while there has been progress in overall literacy rates across India, a substantial gender gap of 14.42% persists. West Bengal has shown the most improvement.
